## About

Cost to Serve (CTS) is a framework that helps organisations understand and visualise the real costs involved in delivering services. It bridges service design thinking with business language by quantifying:

- **Direct costs** - Actor/role salaries broken down to hourly and per-minute rates
- **Indirect costs** - Organisational overheads (rent, training, utilities, tools)
- **Journey mapping** - Time allocation across customer journey stages
- **Total cost analysis** - Cost per transaction and cost per customer

## Features

- 🧭 **Guided wizard** - 6-step process that doesn't overwhelm
- 💰 **Real-time calculations** - See costs update as you input data
- 📊 **Visual dashboards** - Bar charts showing cost distribution
- 👥 **Multi-actor support** - Model complex services with many roles
- 🗺️ **Flexible stages** - Customise journey stages to match your service

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Framework

The core formula:

```
Cost to Serve = Total Cost of Service ÷ Number of Customers
```

Where Total Cost = Σ (Actor hourly rate × Time spent per stage)
